Introduction
Understanding how lifestyle choices affect sleep efficiency can help improve overall health and well-being. This project aims to analyze the impact of smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity on different sleep stages (light and deep sleep) using a dataset of randomized individuals.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

Age: Age of the individual in years.
Gender: Gender of the individual.
Bedtime: Time the individual goes to bed.
Wakeup Time: Time the individual wakes up.
Sleep Duration: Total hours of sleep.
Sleep Efficiency: Percentage of time spent asleep while in bed.
Light Sleep Percentage: Percentage of sleep spent in light sleep.
Deep Sleep Percentage: Percentage of sleep spent in deep sleep.
Awakenings: Number of times the individual wakes up during the night.
Caffeine Consumption: Amount of caffeine consumed daily (mg).
Alcohol Consumption: Amount of alcohol consumed daily (units).
Smoking Status: Indicates if the individual smokes.
Exercise Frequency: Frequency of physical activity per week.
Research Question
How do smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity influence the efficiency and stages of sleep (light and deep sleep)?

Hypotheses
Smoking
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Smoking has no effect on sleep efficiency or the duration of light and deep sleep stages.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Smoking negatively affects sleep efficiency and reduces the duration of light and deep sleep stages.
Alcohol
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Alcohol consumption has no effect on sleep efficiency or the duration of light and deep sleep stages.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Alcohol consumption negatively affects sleep efficiency, decreases deep sleep, and increases light sleep duration.
Exercise
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Exercise frequency has no effect on sleep efficiency or the duration of light and deep sleep stages.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Regular exercise positively affects sleep efficiency, increasing the duration of deep sleep.
Population and Sampling
The population of interest includes randomized individuals from a dataset available on Kaggle. Random sampling was used to ensure a diverse range of individuals, reducing selection bias.

Analysis Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the dataset to understand the distribution of sleep stages and lifestyle factors.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between lifestyle factors and different sleep stages.
Regression Analysis: Quantifying the impact of each lifestyle factor on sleep efficiency and stages.
Visualization: Creating graphs and charts to visually represent the relationships and findings.
Hypothesis Testing: Using statistical tests to evaluate the hypotheses.
Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into how smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity affect different stages of sleep. Understanding these relationships can help individuals make informed decisions to improve their sleep quality.

Potential Issues
Data Quality: Inaccurate or incomplete data could skew results.
Confounding Variables: Other unmeasured factors may influence sleep patterns.
Generalizability: Findings may not be applicable to all populations if the dataset is not representative.
Causal Inference: Establishing causality is challenging with observational data.
